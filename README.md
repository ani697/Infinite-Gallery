Infinite Gallery as the name suggest, gallery which has infinite image and which can be scrolled infinitely.
Infinite Images really !!!ðŸ˜±
Well,ðŸ˜… i know its not true, the thing is, i created an illusion which seems like user can scrolled infinitely without having any end.
In this project i showed how an infinite scroll can be made. Well there are also few library which perform infinite scrolling very well and efficient. But its always better to understand the logic behind any thing, and in this case the logic seems to be little bit complicated but the truth is its not.
In Infinite scrolling website upload the data as the user keep scrolling, if we skip infinite scroll the webpage will load all the data at a time (which can take a good time depends on much the data is going to be loaded).This type of scrolling is useful when the webpage has large amount of data which can take a good time if all the data load at onces. Infinte scrolling aid the user to keep viewing or reading the data while the rest of data is being loaded. Its kind of asynchronous where user keep reading the front data and web page is loading the rest data as user scrolling down.
The logic of creating infinite scroll is depend on 3 things:-
1) scrollTop
2) clientHeight
3) scrollHeight
